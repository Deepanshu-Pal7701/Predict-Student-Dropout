# Predict-Student-Dropout

This project focuses on predicting whether a student is at risk of dropping out based on key academic and behavioral factors like attendance, grades, and class participation. The model uses machine learning classification techniques to identify patterns that indicate dropout risks.

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:

Attendance: Student's attendance percentage

Grades: Academic performance across subjects

Participation: Level of engagement in classroom activities

Other features depending on the dataset structure

The target column is Dropout, where:

1 indicates a student at risk of dropping out

0 indicates a student not at risk
